						It’s hard to imagine seeing the world through different eyes. As bees buzz about their lives, they see different colors, light intensity, and details compared to the human gaze. This unique vision helps them find nectar-rich flowers and navigate the world around their hive. Bees see with their five eyes. They have three smaller ocelli on top of their heads and two large, more prominent ones on either side. Each of these larger eyes is called a compound eye. <br><br>
						The Ocelli Help Honey Bees Find Light. The ocelli sit at the center of the top of the bee’s head. These ocelli have single lenses that measure light intensity. Its primary function is to help the bee find a light source and orient itself as it navigates the world. The Compound Eye Helps Honey Bees See Color. <br><br>
						Each compound eye, which sits on either side of the bee’s head, is made of thousands of tiny lenses. Each of these lenses, known as facets, captures a small part of the bee’s vision, which the brain then stitches together to compose a full picture of what it sees.
					Facets are the main component of the bee’s eyes that lets them see color. </p>

						It also allows them to see things at an extremely wide angle. These facets are responsible for the bee’s sharp vision.
						A typical worker bee can have 6,900 facets, while a drone bee can have up to 8,600 facets, which it will need to locate the queen bee during its mating flight.<br>

				<div class="col-4"><p>Like humans, bees are trichromatic. Bee eyes contain three photoreceptors. The bee’s vision is based on the three colors these photoreceptors can read.
				Unlike humans, whose color vision is based on red, blue, and green. </div>

				<div class="col-6 offset-8"><h4>The vision of a bee is based on blue, green, and ultraviolet light.</h4></div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-4 offset-8">
					<p>
						Ultraviolet light has shorter wavelengths and is generally invisible to the human eye.
						Bees see approximately 300 to 650 nanometers of the light spectrum, while humans can see 390 to 750 nanometers. So while bees can’t see the color red, they can see ultraviolet light at its range of 100 to 400 nanometers.<br>
						Bees can see polarized light too! Polarized light is a kind of light whose vibrations occur in a single plane. The amazing bees’ eyes can scan the sky for polarization patterns in the atmosphere. They can use this to obtain location information which they relay back to the colony.
					Being able to see polarized light allows a honey bee to find its way around even when there’s no sunlight. </p></div>

						As explained above, bees are not able to see all colors. A bee’s eyes are simply not equipped to see the color red, although they can see reddish wavelengths like yellow and orange. However, they can see ultraviolet light, which is out of the range of human sight. </p>

						How Honey Bees Use Their Vision. To a honey bee, ultraviolet light reveals patterns on certain flower petals. Humans can’t see these patterns, but a honey bee’s eyes can see and use these nectar guides as a sort of landing strip to find nectar-rich flowers. <br>
						This also means that bees are better at finding specific types of flowers, even in a field of similar shapes and colors. They can see far more unique details on flowers than humans can. <br>
					Thanks to the bees’ eyes' ability to easily see and distinguish light and dark, they are adept at identifying edges and the different shapes of flowers. </div>

							Besides these, bees may dance to show another bee the location of a food source. If a food source is detected nearby, they perform an uncomplicated routine called a “round dance.” This dance involves the scout bee performing loops in alternative directions.<br>
							However, it performs a “waggle” dance if the food source is farther away. This special dance occurs on a dance floor near a honeycomb entrance. Only honey bees with news of a particularly rich nectar source can perform the dance. This waggle dance consists of doing a figure-eight pattern, a walk between loops, and an irregular wing flutter. Why Do Honey Bees Have Hairy Eyes?<br>
							Not all bee species have hairy eyes, but honey bees certainly do! A honey bee’s entire body is covered with hair, including its eyes. But why is that so?<br>
							The main reason for honey bees’ fuzzy bodies is that they get covered in pollen when they visit flowers. And yes, the pollen does get stuck in their eyes. </p></div>

As a result, honey bees engage in frequent eye cleaning by transferring pollen accumulated on their eye hairs to their legs. Flowers have developed the ability to generate UV patterns on their surfaces, which serve as attractive signals for bees.

The bee’s unique eyesight and seeing apparatus also evolved to help them perform this role in the best way possible. As nature’s primary pollinators, bees see the world in, quite literally, a different light. But it’s this unique adaptation that lets them perform what only they do best. </p></div>
